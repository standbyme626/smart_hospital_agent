# External Repositories

The following large auxiliary repositories were moved out of this project root
to keep `smart_hospital_agent` focused on runtime code and project docs.

## New locations

- [`GPTQModel`](/home/kkk/Project/GPTQModel)
- [`llama.cpp`](/home/kkk/Project/llama.cpp)
- [`local_llama_factory`](/home/kkk/Project/local_llama_factory)

## Notes

- These repositories are no longer stored under
  `/home/kkk/Project/smart_hospital_agent/`.
- If local tooling references old relative paths, update paths to
  `/home/kkk/Project/<repo_name>`.
